Kiba Common is a companion gem to [Kiba](https://github.com/thbar/kiba) and [Kiba Pro](https://github.com/thbar/kiba/blob/master/Pro-Changes.md) in which I'll share commonly used helpers.

Please consider it a work-in-progress for the time being.

In particular, review the changes when updating, until a proper release is ready.

## Contributing & Legal

(agreement below borrowed from Sidekiq Legal)

By submitting a Pull Request, you disavow any rights or claims to any changes submitted to the Kiba Common project and assign the copyright of those changes to LoGeek SARL.

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (your employment contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a PR. Open an issue and someone else can do the work.

This is a legal way of saying "If you submit a PR to us, that code becomes ours". 99.9% of the time that's what you intend anyways; we hope it doesn't scare you away from contributing.
